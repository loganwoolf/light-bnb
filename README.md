# light-bnb

## Info
A backend project that integrates a previous assignment's PostgreSQL database with a pre-built express server and a pre-built frontend.
Functions were written that pass queries to the database (in a safe manner). 
A stretch assignment added a structural refactor that passed all queries through a logging function.
See the `./LightBnB_WebApp/server/database.js` and `./LightBnB_WebApp/db/index.js` files for my work.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the `./LightBnB_WebApp` folder and do 
```js 
npm i
npm run local
```
Then visit `localhost:3000` in your browser.
